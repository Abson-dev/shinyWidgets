## Test environments

* local Windows 10 install, R 3.6.1
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note


## Reverse dependencies

* I unfortunately couldn't test all the dependencies due to an error with one of them (rpostgisLT).
  Those tested not reported problems (one with error, viromeBrowser, installation issue)
  Summary available here: https://github.com/dreamRs/shinyWidgets/blob/master/revdep/README.md
